    <p>
    My mom has had Siamese cats since she was 12 years old. So there has always been one in my house since I was born. Since I was 13, we have had Stella. <br></br>
    One of my best friends, Nick, really liked Stella and once he left to college he wanted one of his own siamese cats. Believe me everyone told him it wasn’t a good idea.

    <p>
He wanted a male siamese cat and got in contact with the same lady that we got Stella from years earlier. She agreed, and Nick was set to get a cat in October 2018. According to Nick, Julian was giving him hell, being a pain, and peeing on his boyfriend’s clothes (lol). That December, Nick drove home with Julian and was thinking he might give him back to the breeder lady. He didn’t want to but he didn’t know what else to do.      </p>

    <p>My mother and I were in love with Julian so my mom thought that she would “foster” Julian. Stella is shy and was scared of Julian at first but now they’re best friends. I don’t think Nick will ever ask for Julian back, and if he did I don’t think he would actually get him back. </p>
