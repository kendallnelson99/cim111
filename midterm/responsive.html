    My mom has had siamese cats since she was 12 years old. So there has always been one siamese in my household since I was born.<br></br>
    First there is my moms cat her name is Stella and we’ve had her since I was 13 years old.
    One of my best friends, Nick, really liked Stella and once he left to college he wanted one of his own siamese cats. Believe me everyone told him it wasn’t a good idea. But he wanted a male siamese cat and got in contact with the same lady that we got Stella from years earlier. She agreed and Nick was set to get a cat in October 2018.

According to Nick, Julian was giving him hell, being a pain, and peeing on his boyfriend’s clothes (lol). December, Nick drove home with Julian and was thinking he might give him back to the breeder lady. He didn’t want to but he didn’t know what to do. My mother and I were in love with Julian so my mom thought that she would “foster” Julian.     </p>

    <p>Stella is shy and was scared of Julian at first but now they’re best friends. I don’t think Nick will ever ask for Julian back, and if he did I don’t think he would actually get him back. </p>
