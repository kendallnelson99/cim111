      For this project I learned HTML format with a basic understanding of CSS to make this Resume. I also include links that show past visitation. This was the first time I made any type of website. I reallt enjoyed making this and learning the specific process that goes into making a website even if it is a simple one.

  I made the webside about my siamese cat named Julian. I used my knowledge of CSS to make this website. I got to design a more cohesive website that looked more legit that than the last one, it even has a navigation! Here i was introduced to grid sections, ID's and classes. I also was able to link an external style shit. It is responsive through mobile as well. I enjoyed making this one the most <br></br>

  <h4><br></br></h4>
This is my "How to" website. For this I learned javascript, jQuery, and jQuery plug-ins. I found a simple recipe for Mini Oreo Cheesecake and made my website about it. Using hover and mouse enter I created this site. This one for some reason was particularly difficult and I found myself getting frustrated and discouraged often. It is no where near how I want it to be but hopefully with some more work I can get it how I envisioned it to be.
