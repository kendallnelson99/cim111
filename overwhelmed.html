            <h1>Objective</h1>
            <h3>The goal of this project was to represent an emotion of our choosing. I chose overwhelmed. I created a paper box with a silhouette of a person and cut out shapes and icons that I thought visibly showed the emotion.>

            <h3>Sculpture</h3>
          <p>I got the template to make this box using Template Maker. I got the silhouette outline from google. I used Cricut Maker to cut the box and it also drew the silhouette</p>

          <h3>Code</h3>
          <P>I used a sequencing code to create my pattern. It goes Red, Yellow, Red. It creates kind of an orange color when the yellow is introduced.

          <h3>
          Circut
          </h3>

          <p>3- 220 ohm resistors. 1- 10K resistor </p><p>2 - Red LED 1- Yellow LED</p> <p>1 - Ardiuno uno</p>
          <p>1 - Switch</p>

          <h3>Issues</h3>
          <p>Because of my sequencing pattern it was difficult for me to get my push button code to work. Another think is i should  have put a Duralar paper to diffuse the light and so that you cant see the LEDs from the outside.</p>
